			<h1>About the CampMap!</h1>
			<p>This is NOT the official map. The official map is not online.</p>

			<h2>Who made this visual representation?</h2>
			<p>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/mazdermind">@MaZderMind</a>, I made the visual representation of the #cccamp15 Area. I did *not* specify where/if you're village is located, where the power outlets are or how many toilets are on the camp. If you want to talk to me about the visual representation and interaction on this map, you can meet me at the c3voc <a href="http://goo.gl/kx55EA" alt="Link to Google!">Office or -Village</a> on the camp or contact me via one of the channels stated on <a href="http://mazdermind.de/">mazdermind.de</a> (preferring E-Mail).</p>
			<p>The Code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/MaZderMind/campmap/">on GitHub</a>. Opening an Issue may or may not help. I'm a busy guy.</p>

			<h2>Where does the data come from?</h2>
			<p>As stated above, I'm not the Author of the data displayed on this map. The data is collected in a Wiki-Like system, originally built by and for <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and located at <a href="https://maps.c3voc.de/">maps.c3voc.de</a>. Some parts of it has been copied from official plans, some parts have been added by Villages. Because it's a wiki, there is no truth in it. This visual representation is updated once per hour from the data stored there.</p>

			<h2>There's an issue!</h2>
			<p>Because it's a wiki, you can change things, if you want to, by creating an account at <a href="https://maps.c3voc.de/">maps.c3voc.de</a>. But beware, it takes some time to understand all the bits and pieces.</p>
			<p>If all you want is report a small misstake, hop on to <tt>#camp-maps</tt> or <tt>#camp</tt> on the <a href="http://hackint.eu/">hackint.eu</a> IRC Network or write an E-Mail to the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Static:Contact">Orga-Team</a>.

			<h2>Where is my Village??!??</h2>
			<p>Only Top-Level Villages &gt;20 People are placed on the map. Village-Areas are only <u>estimations</u>, there are no fences, you'll need to <u>negotiate</u> with your neighbors.</p>
			<p>If you did so and want to inform others where you can meet them, add your village as a Point with <tt>place=village</tt>, <tt>name=&lt;your name&gt;</tt> to the map or ask someone in <tt>#camp-maps</tt> to do so.</p>

			<h2>But on the map my Village is here!!!?!</h2>
			<p>The Map is not the truth. Where you're village will actually be decided on-place. Just because something is on the map does not give you any rights or assurances it will actually happen. Furthermore, there are no fences, you'll need to <u>negotiate</u> with your neighbors. Be excellent to each other.</p>
